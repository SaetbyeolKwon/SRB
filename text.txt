The Polar Express  by Chris Van Allsburg. On Christmas Eve, many years ago, I lay quietly in my bed.  I did not rustle the sheets.  I breathed slowly and silently.  I was listening for a sound – a sound a friend had told me I’d never hear- the ringing bells of Santa’s sleigh. “There is no Santa,” my friend had insisted, but I knew he was wrong. Late that night I did hear sounds, though not of ringing bells.  From outside came the sounds of hissing steam and squeaking metal.  I looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in front of my house. It was wrapped in an apron of steam.  Snowflakes fell lightly around it.  A conductor stood at the open door of one of the cars.  He took a large pocket watch from his vest, then looked up at my window.  I put on my slippers and robe.  I tiptoed downstairs and out the door. “All aboard,” the conductor cried out.  I ran up to him. “Well, he said, “are you coming?” “Where?” I asked. “Why to the North Pole of course,” was his answer.  “This is the Polar Express.”  I took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard.
